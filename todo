* Academy upgrade to University says "not enough room" when there is

* canDemolish should do checks as to whether removing that building would break adjacency restrictions for its neighbours

* Not adjacency restriction needs to apply to all of a large building (currently just enforces "base" lot).  Should also restrict rotations of 2x1 building.

* UC only: Leadership feat bonus to realm leader bonus

* Rename/modify list of ruler roles based on ruleset

* thrown melee weapons which can have both types of enhancements

Need to handle lots containing multiple buildings

Need to handle "parameterised" lots, that can contain (e.g.) a skill getting a lore bonus or a temple's alignment/variable kingdom bonusses.  Might as well allow custom rotation of building image as well.

Prompt for parameter on constructing buildings that need them

* UC: Houses (specifically) can only fulfill one adjacency demand each

UCam discounts only work once, for one of the listed buildings.

House rule: city defenses are divided by # of districts

House rule: city walls are per-district and defend on all sides

House rule interface to edit/add custom buildings.

Alert when loading unknown buildings/leadership roles, prompting for substitution.  Initialise with Acadamy -> Academy and Marshall -> Marshal
